Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
==============================
I have been reading a lot about different algorithms and data structures. This project consists of my efforts to build them.

The first data-structure I have decided to create in Ruby is the linked list. So far, I have created singly and circularly linked lists. I have also added an enumerable module to the singly linked list class.
